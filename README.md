# CEbUTAl
This is the official repository for CEbUTAl: A Confidence and Entropy based Uncertainty Thresholding Algorithm.

## About CEbUTAl
Advances in AI and machine learning have transformed medical image analysis, improving diagnostic accuracy, image quality, and measurements. However, the "black-box" nature of deep learning models raises trust and ethical concerns. To address this, we introduce CEbUTAl (Confidence and Entropy-based Uncertainty Thresholding Algorithm), which enhances explainability without compromising performance by adjusting predictions based on uncertainty. CEbUTAl improves classification accuracy to 88% in intracranial hemorrhage detection, 95% in optical coherence tomography, and 78% in breast cancer detection. Its real-time uncertainty correction enhances model transparency, making it a valuable tool for trustworthy clinical decision-making.
